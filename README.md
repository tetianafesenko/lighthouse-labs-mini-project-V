The repo with instructions for Mini Project V

Welcome to your final mini-project of this bootcamp. We hope you will enjoy it. 

### Description

We will combine the skills we developed in the previous modules to identify duplicate questions in a dataset provided by Quora. This dataset  was labeled by human experts which is an expensive process. The model you will build will need to automatically identify and label duplicate questions.

We are going to need to build a classifier model to achieve this result..


### Data

The labeled dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19iWVGLBi7edqybybam56bt2Zy7vpf1Xc/view?usp=sharing).

Based on the results of the logistic regression and XGBoost models, it can be concluded that both models are effective in classifying duplicate questions. Both models achieved similar accuracy levels, with logistic regression performing slightly better in some cases. The choice of the model to use may depend on the specific requirements and limitations of the project. Logistic regression is a simple and interpretable model, making it easier to understand the relationships between features and the target variable. XGBoost, on the other hand, is a powerful and flexible model that is known for its ability to handle large datasets and produce high accuracy. Ultimately, it is important to carefully evaluate the trade-offs and perform thorough cross-validation before making a final decision on the model to use.
